Of course we launched the new JRuby.org yesterday. There's still some content to be refined/revised and plenty of styling to clean up, but it's a vast improvement over our previous non-existent web presence. We're thrilled with the design of the site and keen to add more useful content over the next couple weeks.

And for anyone interested, contact [marknutter@gmail.com](mailto:marknutter@gmail.com) if you want to get a similarly smoov design for a site of your own.
