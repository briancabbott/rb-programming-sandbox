Do you totally love JRuby? Of course you do. Want a t-shirt to show the world just how much you love JRuby? Of course you do. Here's how you can get one.

* Write up an amazing blog post about JRuby – your experience with it, something great you've learned about it (and yourself), clever solutions to tricky problems, etc
* Present about JRuby at a local meetup – try to video record it and post it online
* Give a talk about JRuby at a conference
* Convince the company that you work for to start using JRuby in its stack
* Get part of your work time budget to [contribute to JRuby](https://github.com/jruby/jruby) and/or [JRuby related projects](http://twitter.com/nicksieger/status/111172038349164545)

Do one of those things and you'll earn yourself one of these super comfy t-shirts to wear proudly.
