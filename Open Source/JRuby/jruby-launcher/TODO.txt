Things that are not yet implemented:

* --jdb
* Do we need separate x86 and x64 binaries?
  (Without separate binaries, x64 java will always be launched out-of-process).
  Currently, the build can hanble both, x86 and x64 compilers and can build both
  versions. But for now, we ship JRuby only with x32 version.
