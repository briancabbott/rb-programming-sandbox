- Get rid of RackApplicationFactory; make custom factories just a decorating RackApplication instead
  - Move JRuby runtime factory logic into separate small factory that accepts a rackup script
- Introduce application bootstrap strategy concept
  - Get rid of custom context listeners, instead accept a "application type" context init param
  - The default application bootstrap strategy should be a new automatic bootstrapper that attempts
    to detect the application type
- Try to support a public root other than '/' in RackFilter
- Rails: detect JNDI connections and auto-close connections after each request (clear_active_connections!)
