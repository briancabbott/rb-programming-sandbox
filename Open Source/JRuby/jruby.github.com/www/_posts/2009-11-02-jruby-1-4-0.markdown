title: JRuby 1.4.0 Released
---
The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 1.4.0

- Homepage: [http://www.jruby.org/](http://www.jruby.org/)
- Download: [http://www.jruby.org/download](http://www.jruby.org/download)

After three very helpful release candidates we have a final 1.4.0 release.
This release ends a long release cycle in which we resolved a huge number of
issues. The headline feature is a move to Ruby 1.8.7 support, in line with
Rails' own plans to make 1.8.7 the required minimum version of Ruby.  

  We have also gotten more serious about out 1.9 support (--1.9).  The
bigger applications mostly just work at this point, but we still have a
ways to go on 1.9 support.  Please try your 1.9 code in JRuby and help us
firm things up.

### 1.4.0 Highlights:
- JRuby is now compatible with 1.8.7 patchlevel 174
- Windows Native Launcher
  - Solves many reported bugs with our old .bat scripts
- New YAML parser Yecht (bug-for-bug compatible with Syck!)
- Improved Java Integration Support
  - faster
  - new java_method, java_send, and java_alias methods
- Windows installer
- New embedding framework
  - Java 6 scripting out of the box
  - New org.jruby.embed package to supersede JavaEmbedUtils
- Many 1.9 mode (--1.9) fixes
  - updated stdlib to 1.9.2preview2
  - Rubygems now working
  - Rails 2.3.3 simple apps working (2.3.4 has 1.9 bug)
- rubygems 1.3.5
- Much better error reporting
  - shorter backtraces with less Java
  - Ruby-compatiable syntax error reporting
- 307 bugs fixed since 1.3.1

We want to thank all the users who have been helping us to get a better
release out.  Special thanks to Hiro Asari, David Calavera, and
Roger Pack for their recent activity in the project.  We also want to
welcome Yoko Harada as a committer to the project.  Her work and
support of our embedding efforts has been great.
