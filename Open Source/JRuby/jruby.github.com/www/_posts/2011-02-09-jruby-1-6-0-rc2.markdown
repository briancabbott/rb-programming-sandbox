JRuby 1.6.0.RC2 is the second release candidate of JRuby 1.6.0.

JRuby 1.6.0 is the largest release of JRuby to date. This release
fixes hundreds of user issues and brings compatibility with Ruby 1.9.2
to a very high level. We have made Windows a primary supported
platform by adding it as a continuous integration platform, and JRuby
1.6 will provide Windows-based Ruby users with the best experience
yet. This release integrates experimental support for C extensions
based on Ruby's C API. And as with all major releases, we have
improved stability and performance across the board in response to
real-world user input.

We encourage Ruby and JRuby users alike to test out 1.6.0.RC2 to help
us shake out remaining issues. It would be especially helpful if users
would test out 1.9 mode (by passing --1.9 flag) to help us round out
our 1.9.2 compatibility before the final 1.6.0 release.

### Notable changes since 1.6.0.RC1:
- Large number of 1.9 compatibility issues addressed
  - Encoding issues (especially involving Regexp)
  - Fiddle implementation
  - non-ASCII identifiers
- irb (1.8.7, 1.9.2) and command prompt added to Windows installer
- Compiler handles all 1.9 syntax now
- Fixes for new backtrace accuracy, reliability
- Removed all GPL or LGPL-only dependencies
- Updated to RubyGems 1.5.0
- C extension support prebuilt for OS X, Linux (32/64), Windows (32)
- 83 issues resolved since RC1

### Major Features:

- Ruby 1.9.2 language and API compatibility

  - Not implemented Encoding::Converter, ripper
- Improved Ruby call performance
- Built-in profiler (--profile, --profile.graph)
- RSpec no longer bundled
- C Extension support (experimental)
- RubyGems Maven support (preview)
- Improved compatibility and user experience on Windows
