JRuby 1.6.0.RC3 is the last release candidate of JRuby 1.6.0.

JRuby 1.6.0 is the largest release of JRuby to date. This release
fixes hundreds of user issues and brings compatibility with Ruby 1.9.2
to a very high level. We have made Windows a primary supported
platform by adding it as a continuous integration platform, and JRuby
1.6 will provide Windows-based Ruby users with the best experience
yet. This release integrates experimental support for C extensions
based on Ruby's C API. And as with all major releases, we have
improved stability and performance across the board in response to
real-world user input.

We are going to seriously try and make this our last RC before going final.
Unless we find something devestatingly bad we will release 1.6.0 and then
try and spin smaller point builds every 2-3 weeks to address reported 
problems.

### Notable changes since 1.6.0.RC2:
- New readable backtrace format
