title: JRuby 1.6.1 Released
---
The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 1.6.1.

- Homepage: [http://www.jruby.org/](http://www.jruby.org/)
- Download: [http://www.jruby.org/download](http://www.jruby.org/download)

JRuby 1.6.1 is our first update to 1.6.0.  The primary goal of the 1.6.x 
series is to round out our 1.9 support by fixing any reported 
incompatibilities.  Of course, as with any JRuby release, we will continue
fixing any found incompatibilities and also improve performance. All users 
of 1.6.0 (and lower) are encouraged to upgrade to 1.6.1.

### Notable Changes:

- Numerous 1.9-mode features and bugs fixed
- Various fixes to installing and running C extensions
- Kernel.exec on windows does a native exec (CreateProcess)
- Performance fixes for non-blocking IO methods
- Performance tweaks for Array, String, and a few other core classes
- Updated JSR292 (invokedynamic) support
- 193 commits and 47 issues resolved since 1.6.0
