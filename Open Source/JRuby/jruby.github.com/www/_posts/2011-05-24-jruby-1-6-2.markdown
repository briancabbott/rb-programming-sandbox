title: JRuby 1.6.2 Released
---
The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 1.6.2.

JRuby 1.6.2 is our second update to 1.6.x.  The main motivation besides spinning incremental releases quicker was a nasty YAML bug which prevented a number of Rubygems from installing (see JRUBY-5581 -- ArrayIndexOutOfBounds problem).  Expect JRuby 1.6.3 in a couple of weeks.

The primary goal of the 1.6.x series is to round out our 1.9 support by fixing any reported incompatibilities. Of course, as with any JRuby release, we will continue fixing any found incompatibilities and also improve performance. All users of 1.6.1 (and lower) are encouraged to upgrade to 1.6.2.

### Notable Changes:

- YAML problem generating an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception JRUBY-5581
- Java names of the form getX were not getting aliases of get_x, x (regression)
- A couple of embedding errors (JRUBY-5734, JRUBY-5635)
- A few 1.9 issues resolved

### 1.6.2 Issues Resolved:
