title: JRuby 1.6.7 Released
---
The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 1.6.7.

- Homepage: [http://www.jruby.org/](http://www.jruby.org/)
- Download: [http://www.jruby.org/download](http://www.jruby.org/download)

The primary goal of the 1.6.x series is to round out our 1.9 support by fixing any reported incompatibilities. Of course, as with any JRuby release, we will continue fixing any found incompatibilities and also improve performance. All users of 1.6.6 (and lower) are encouraged to upgrade to 1.6.7.

Some astute readers of our release announcements will remember this snippet:

   "Because master keeps getting further and further away from our 1.6 branch we have decided to make this our last 1.6 release.  We largely fulfilled our goal of having reasonable 1.9 support."

After releasing 1.6.6, we got a smallish flood of simple to fix 1.9 compatibility issues.  We realized our charter of reasonable 1.9 support had not quite been reached.  So we decided to put out 1.6.7.  As of JRuby 1.6.7, we think we are leaving the 1.6 series at a nice stopping point.  Plus, 1.7.0 is less than two months away.  

### Notable Changes:

- Fix circular require issue in Rubygems introduced by our Maven gem support
- Fix regression in popen* where streams get prematurely closed
- Many 1.9-mode encoding bugs fixed in String, Regexp, StringIO, and YAML
- Win32OLE now works in 1.9-mode
- ffi on Win x64 now knows about basic types :size_t
- Use jzlib to fix a set of issues with out zlib library
- Reduced internal locking based on user reports
- C extensions work on OS X again
- Gems with gemspecs which contain UTF-8 multi-byte chars install in 1.9 mode
