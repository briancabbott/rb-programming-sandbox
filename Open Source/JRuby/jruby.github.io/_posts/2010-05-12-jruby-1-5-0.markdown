title: JRuby 1.5.0 Released

The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 1.5.0.

This development cycle has been our longest cycle yet (nearly 5 months), but it also has the most fixes.  It also includes many new notable features (see below).  Most of our bug fixes have been more of what we consider fine-tuning, since we keep getting into smaller corner-cases of compatibility for individual Ruby methods.  In that sense, we expect if you had a good experience with JRuby 1.4.0 then 1.5.0 will be a no-brainer upgrade.  If you haven't tried JRuby in a while with your application, then please give us another try.  Odds are whatever issue you were having before no longer exists!

### 1.5.0 Highlights:

- New native access framework designed for performance and better FFI support
- Native launcher for \*NIX platforms
- Ant support and Rake-Ant integration
- Better and better support for Windows
- Multiple performance improvements for Ruby-to-Java calling, improving correctness, memory, and speed.
- Embedding API improvements based on user input (JSR-223, BSF, RedBridge, etc)
- Software updates: Ruby 1.8.7 standard library update, RubyGems 1.3.6, RSpec 1.3.0
- ruby-debug installed by default
- Many fixes for Rails 3
- Various improvements to startup time
- Improved performance for Object#object\_id/\_\_id\_\_
- Reduced memory use for Java class metadata and faster loading of Java classes
- jar-in-jar support in the classloader
- The "open4" library now works properly
- jruby.jit.codeCache=dir to save jitted scripts/methods to disk in a sha1-hashed .class file
- New logic for interface implementation that produces "real" classes
- jruby.ji.objectProxyCache to turn off OPC for extra performance
- JRuby::Synchronized module for making a class and its subclasses 100% synchronized on all calls
- Miscellaneous perf improvements to core classes and minor improvements in the JIT
- No more ObjectSpace during IRB
- Cleaned up maven artifacts
- Windows Installer fixes for x64 and Windows 7 security
- Over 1250 commits since JRuby 1.4
