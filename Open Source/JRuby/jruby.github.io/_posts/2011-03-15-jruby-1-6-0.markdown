JRuby 1.6.0 final is out!

JRuby 1.6.0 is the largest release of JRuby to date. This release
fixes hundreds of user issues and brings compatibility with Ruby 1.9.2
to a very high level. We have made Windows a primary supported
platform by adding it to our continuous integration environment.  JRuby
1.6 will provide Windows-based Ruby users with the best experience
yet. This release integrates experimental support for C extensions
based on Ruby's C API. And as with all major releases, we have
improved stability and performance across the board in response to
real-world user input.

Over the next month or two we plan on putting out quicker point releases
in anticipation that 1.6.0 will get a new wave of feedback.  Give JRuby
1.6.0 a try and let us know how things go.
