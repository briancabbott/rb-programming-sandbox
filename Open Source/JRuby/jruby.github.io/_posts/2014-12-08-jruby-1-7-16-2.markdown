JRuby 1.7.16.2 is our eighteenth update release since JRuby 1.7.0.  The primary goal of 1.7 point releases is to fill out any missing compatibility issues with Ruby 1.9.3.  

1.7.16.2 is a security fix release for [CVE-2014-8090](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8090).  All users are strongly recommended to upgrade.   For more information, check out the excellent write up on [www.ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2014/11/13/rexml-dos-cve-2014-8090/).

For those wondering, JRuby 1.7.17 is going to be out tomorrow (barring any last minute showstoppers).  This will include not only this security fix but almost 2 months of bug fixes.
