fails:String#=~ raises a TypeError if a obj is a string
fails:String#=~ invokes obj.=~ with self if obj is neither a string nor regexp
fails:String#=~ sets $~ to MatchData when there is a match and nil when there's none
fails:String#=~ returns the character index of a found match
fails:String#match matches the pattern against self
fails:String#match matches a literal Regexp that uses ASCII-only UTF-8 escape sequences
fails:String#match tries to convert pattern to a string via to_str
fails:String#match raises a TypeError if pattern is not a regexp or a string

fails:String#match returns nil if there's no match
fails:String#match matches \G at the start of the string
fails:String#match sets $~ to MatchData of match or nil when there is none
fails:String#match calls match on the regular expression
fails:String#match with [pattern, position] when given a positive position matches the pattern against self starting at an optional index
fails:String#match with [pattern, position] when given a positive position uses the start as a character offset
fails:String#match with [pattern, position] when given a negative position matches the pattern against self starting at an optional index
fails:String#match with [pattern, position] when given a negative position uses the start as a character offset
fails:String#match when passed a block yields the MatchData
fails:String#match when passed a block returns the block result
fails:String#match when passed a block does not yield if there is no match
