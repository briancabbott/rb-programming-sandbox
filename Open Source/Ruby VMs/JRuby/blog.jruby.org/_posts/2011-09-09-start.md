# Ready, Set... Go!

For some time now, there's been a [unified feed of mostly release notes](http://jruby.org/atom.xml "JRuby.org News"). But never really a unified place for non-release notes information about JRuby. There was the [Engine Yard blog](http://www.engineyard.com/blog/?s=jruby "Jruby | Engine Yard Ruby on Rails Blog"), [Charles Nutter's blog](http://blog.headius.com/ "Headius"), [Nick Sieger's blog](http://blog.nicksieger.com "Nick Sieger"), [Tom Enebo's blog](http://blog.enebo.com "Tom's Ruminations") and [various other sources](http://www.google.com/search?q=jruby "jruby - Google Search"). (The release notes feed will continue to exist. No need to change your feed readers.)

Today we change that. You now are looking at the new home for news, information and all of the things JRuby related that aren't release notes. 

Tell your friends and stay tuned for more.
