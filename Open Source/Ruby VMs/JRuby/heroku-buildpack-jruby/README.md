# Heroku buildpack for JRuby

A buildpack to fast and easy use JRuby on Heroku. Just create a Heroku app like this:

    heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/jruby/heroku-buildpack-jruby.git 

It will download and unpack JRuby from [jruby.org](http://jruby.org/), install [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) and run ```bundle install``` and then use your ```Procfile```.

Example ```Procfile```:

    web: bin/puma -p $PORT -e $RACK_ENV

Note: You do normally not want to use ```bundle exec``` with JRuby. Use the binstubs (in ```bin/```) instead.

A ```Gemfile``` with a "ruby" line is required. So to use JRuby 1.7.4 in 2.0 mode, put this in you ```Gemfile```:

    ruby '2.0.0', engine: 'jruby', engine_version: '1.7.4'

If you change Ruby version, ie. JRuby mode, don't forget to update ```JRUBY_OPTS```. The buildpack can only set environment variables on first push. 

    $ heroku config:add JRUBY_OPTS="--2.0 -J-Xmx400m -J-XX:+UseCompressedOops -J-noverify"

Otherwise you might end up with errors such as: 

    Bundler::RubyVersionMismatch: Your Ruby version is 1.9.3, but your Gemfile specified 2.0.0

Example application: [github.com/carlhoerberg/heroku-jruby-example](https://github.com/carlhoerberg/heroku-jruby-example)

## JVM version

To use another JVM version, eg. 1.7 (recommended), create a file called ```system.properties``` in your root folder with the following content:

```
java.runtime.version=1.7
```

Note: Currently, supported versions are 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8. The default is 1.6.

This is the same procedure as for all JVM based Heroku buildpacks: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/add-java-version-to-an-existing-maven-app

## Assets

To get the assets precompiled during slug compilation take the following actions: 

1. Replace ```therubyracer``` with ```therubyrhino``` in the ```Gemfile``` (and then run ```bundle``` and commit)
1. Add ```config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false``` to ```config/application.rb``` 
1. Change ```config.serve_static_assets``` to ```true``` in ```config/environments/production.rb```
1. (Optional) Replace ```uglifier``` with ```closure-compiler``` and add ```config.assets.js_compressor = :closure``` to ```config/environments/production.rb```, to get faster compile times.

## Logging

To get Heroku to pick up Rails logs you have to add the following to ```config/environments/production.rb``` 

``` ruby
STDOUT.sync = true
logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
logger.level = Logger::INFO
config.logger = logger
``` 

## Servers

Recommended web servers are:

* [Puma](http://puma.io) - A server written in Ruby, wraps the Ragel parser (from Mongrel)
* [Trinidad](https://github.com/trinidad/trinidad) - A wrapper around [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/)
* [Mizuno](https://github.com/matadon/mizuno) - A wrapper around [Jetty](http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/)

## Multithreading

To get the real benefits of JRuby you should enable multithreading, both in the application server of choice as well as in Rails. 

### Rails

Add ```config.threadsafe!``` to ```config/environments/production.rb``` 

### Trinidad

Add the ```--threadsafe``` flag as a command line argument to Trinidad. 

```web: bin/trinidad --threadsafe --rackup -p $PORT -e $RACK_ENV```
