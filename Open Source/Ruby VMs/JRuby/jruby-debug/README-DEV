== How to setup and run tests

0) checkout the sources (see README, section "Installation of trunk version")
1) apply patch by running:

    $ rake prepare_tests'


You are ready to run all tests, e.g.:

  $ jruby test/test-help.rb 
  $ jruby --debug -S rake test_stable


We need to tweak MRI ruby-debug test suite since the debuggers differs in some
cases:

  - JRuby does not support invalid breakpoint places
  - MRI stops at some expressions, like 'if', twice, JRuby once
