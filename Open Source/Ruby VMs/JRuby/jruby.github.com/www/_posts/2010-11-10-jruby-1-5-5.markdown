title: JRuby 1.5.5 Released
---
The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 1.5.5.

(Note: Due to a showstopper bug found after the release jruby-jars gem and
the inability to remove gem releases from rubygems.org we have skipped 
from 1.5.3 to 1.5.5.  The 1.5.5 release is the same release that would have
been 1.5.4 had we been able to re-release jruby-jars.)

JRuby 1.5.5 is a minor follow-up release to address problems executing
some commands on Windows, a couple of Marshalling discrepancies with MRI, and
a few other random production-affecting issues.  We also improved the output
and accuracy of --profile (try it out).  All users of JRuby 1.5.3 are
recommended to upgrade to 1.5.5.
