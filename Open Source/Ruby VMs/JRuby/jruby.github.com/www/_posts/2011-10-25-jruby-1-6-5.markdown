title: JRuby 1.6.5 Released
---
The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 1.6.5.

- Homepage: [http://www.jruby.org/](http://www.jruby.org/)
- Download: [http://www.jruby.org/download](http://www.jruby.org/download)

The primary goal of the 1.6.x series is to round out our 1.9 support by fixing any reported incompatibilities. Of course, as with any JRuby release, we will continue fixing any found incompatibilities and also improve performance. All users of 1.6.4 (and lower) are encouraged to upgrade to 1.6.5.

### Notable Changes:
- Many --1.9 encoding issues resolved
- .jrubyrc support for storing convenient execution options
- New cext.enabled property to turn off only C extentions but not native support
- C extension support now uses less memory
- Updated to Rubygems 1.8.9
- \-rjruby/thread_dump adds a USR2 Ruby thread dumper
- Improved peformance interacting directly with Java Maps
- Improved fiber performance and support for JVM coroutines
- Improved zlib support
- 36 Issues resolved
