title: JRuby 1.6.4 Released

The JRuby community is pleased to announce the release of JRuby 1.6.4.

The primary goal of the 1.6.x series is to round out our 1.9 support by fixing any reported incompatibilities. Of course, as with any JRuby release, we will continue fixing any found incompatibilities and also improve performance. All users of 1.6.3 (and lower) are encouraged to upgrade to 1.6.4.

### Notable Changes:
- 1\.9 language and core class fixes
- New Native MacOS installer
- Overloaded Java method dispatch perf fix
- Java dispatch block cercion perf fix
- Disabling native now disables C extension support
- JRuby can be built with 1.9 mode by default
- 48 Issues resolved
