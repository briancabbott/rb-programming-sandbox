We stopped the mailing lists on ruby-lang.org temporarily.

Our mailing lists were attacked by a spam bomb.
We stopped the following lists:

 * ruby-core
 * ruby-talk
 * ruby-dev
 * ruby-list
 * ruby-cvs
 * ruby-doc
 * ruby-ext
 * ruby-fr
 * ruby-math

We are sorry if the outage affects you and are working on
resuming the lists as soon as we can.

### Status update 2014-06-16 9:00 +0000

We resumed the mailing lists on ruby-lang.org.
